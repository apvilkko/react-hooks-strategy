# Strategy Pattern with React Hooks

This repository demonstrates how the Strategy Pattern can be implemented when your application logic uses React hooks.

This is a companion repository for my blog post [Advanced React Hooks: The Strategy Pattern](https://gofore.com/en/advanced-react-hooks-the-strategy-pattern/) which explains the use cases and architecture for this pattern.

To run, clone this repo and install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Then start the app:

```
yarn start
```
